## Extra Information

All secrete keys and access tokens uploaded accidentally to this repository have been deleted, to use this respository you will have to download the requirements by yourself as this was my first project and was hard to keep track of every library used. It took me a total of 1 year and 2 months to "complete" this project, I have decided to move on to creating something similar but all web based with more features.
